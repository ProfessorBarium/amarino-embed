Overview
--------
This is an embeddable version of the Amarino library (http://www.amarino-toolkit.net/).  Amarino is originally built to be installed as an Android application which other Android apps depend on.  While this is an acceptable practice (for ex:  Google Navigator does it), this isn't always a pattern that works well for application developers.

Amarino is nice.  It has a simple RPC-like frame-buffer implementation that allows it to execute callbacks on an Arduino connected to a bluetooth module (such as SparkFun's BlueSmirf).  It's easy to use too.

This API decouples the Amarino Service architecture from its application, allowing you to embed Amarino in your own applications.  To keep things simple, and in cases where you intend to use Amarino as a shared application, the old behavior is supported.

Another important change in the API is support for custom MessageBuilder implementations.  This allows you to implement new protocols to talk to Arduino.  Maybe you want to use Google's Protocol Buffers to talk to Arudino.  Maybe you want to send binary data, or BSON over the wireless wire.  No problemï¿½write a custom MessageBuilder implementation and set that in your embedded service.

This is an early project commit.  Please excuse any issues and help contribute to the project -- if you have time to help write code let me know I'd love some help!

Branches
--------
vendor => original Amarino branch.  The jump-point for merging changes from the Google Code source branch.
dev-* => dev branch
trunk => latest stable branch

Getting Started
---------------
Look at the Wiki for basic documentation.  More documentation is needed and will be coming soon.  For now, take a look at android-examples/RGBLEDSliders for a sample of an Android App that uses Amarino as an embedded service.

Known issues
------------
See the issues page in this project.
